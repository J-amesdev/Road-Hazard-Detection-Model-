# Road Hazard Detection using YOLOv8-Nano

## 📌 Project Overview
An AI-powered system designed to detect road hazards in real-time, including **Debris, Potholes, Uneven Terrain, and Road Cracks**. This project is built using the Ultralytics YOLOv8-Nano architecture for high-speed inference on edge devices.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time Detection:** Optimized for mobile and embedded systems.
- **Custom Dataset:** A hybrid dataset combining RDD2022 and locally collected road imagery.
- **Classes:** - Debris
  - Potholes
  - Uneven Terrain
  - Road Cracks
